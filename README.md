# AR-Showcase-2023

With iOS SDK, I am able to create AR apps that allow users to:
1/ Place objects on the floor/walls.
2/ Place objects on the body, not just behind it. I'm currently working on setting up objects behind the body as well.
3/ Create various types of face masks.
4/ Work with tags, whether they are objects or video hooks.
In addition, with Unity SDK, I can create simple games such as car driving, object placement, face masks, and work with tags.

Please, check all the videos that expose this skillset:
